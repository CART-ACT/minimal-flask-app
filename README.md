# minimal-flask-app
Minimal code for a Flask app making calls to the OpenAI API.

You need Python 3 installed. Run the commands below from inside the project folder.


## macOS / Linux

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv

# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip3 install flask openai python-dotenv gunicorn

# Rename the file .env-bup to .env
mv .env-bup .env
# Then open .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run the app
python3 app.py
```

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate your virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the required packages
pip install flask openai python-dotenv gunicorn

# Rename the file .env-bup to .env
Rename-Item .env-bup .env
# Then open .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Notes for Windows:

- If `python` is not recognised, use `py` instead (for example, `py -m venv venv` and `py app.py`).
- If PowerShell says that running scripts is disabled, run this once and try the activation again:
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- With Command Prompt (cmd) instead of PowerShell, activate with `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` and rename with `ren .env-bup .env`.
- `gunicorn` installs on Windows but cannot run there. It is only needed when deploying (for example, on Render), so locally always start the app with `python app.py`.

## Which terminal am I using?

Use a **Linux-style shell** if you can: the commands are the same on every platform, which makes it easier to follow tutorials and to get help.

- **macOS / Linux:** the built-in Terminal already is one. Use the *macOS / Linux* commands below.
- **Windows, recommended:** install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which includes **Git Bash**, or install **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) by running `wsl --install` in PowerShell. Both give you Linux-style commands.
  - In **WSL**, use the *macOS / Linux* commands exactly as written.
  - In **Git Bash**, use the *macOS / Linux* commands, with two changes: use `python` instead of `python3`, and activate with `source venv/Scripts/activate`.
- **Windows, default:** the terminal in VS Code opens **PowerShell** by default (the prompt starts with `PS C:\...`). If you stay with it, use the *Windows (PowerShell)* commands below.

In VS Code, the dropdown next to the `+` in the terminal panel shows which shell is open and lets you pick another one (Git Bash and WSL appear there once installed).

## Check that it works

When the virtual environment is active, `(venv)` appears at the start of your prompt. After `python app.py` (or `python3 app.py`), open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> in your browser.

## Deploying on Render

- **Build command:** `pip install flask openai python-dotenv gunicorn`
- **Start command:** `gunicorn app:app`
- **Environment variable:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your key. Never commit your key to GitHub.

If the deploy fails with `gunicorn: command not found` (status 127), `gunicorn` is missing from the build command. If it fails with `No module named 'openai'`, `openai` is missing.
